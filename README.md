2. Set up Snowflake and Pinecone databases.
3. Develop the FastAPI backend for handling data requests.

### Phase 2: Build Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (Week 2)
1. Create a basic Streamlit interface with dropdowns and chatbot capabilities.
2. Integrate real-time race data using the OpenF1 API.
3. Deploy the RAG bot for regulation-based queries.

### Phase 3: UI Finalization and Testing (Week 3)
1. Enhance the user interface for a seamless experience.
2. Conduct functional and user acceptance testing.
3. Document the platform for ease of use and deployment.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
### Risks
1. **Time Constraints**: Limited development window.
2. **Data Integration Challenges**: Potential compatibility issues between APIs and databases.
3. **API Reliability**: Outages or usage rate limitations may hinder real-time data feeds.
4. **Testing Limitations**: Insufficient time for thorough testing may leave undetected issues.

### Mitigation
1. Prioritize core features and use parallel development for efficiency.
2. Standardize data formats and perform incremental integration testing.
3. Cache data to mitigate API reliability issues.
4. Focus on critical bug fixes during testing to ensure core functionality.
